SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
Create a Smart Navigation System for railway stations using 3D maps and indoor positioning. The system will use mobile phones and smart kiosks to guide users to ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, etc., in real time. It will also support voice commands and text-to-speech for visually impaired users.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
High-Level Architecture:

Frontend:

Mobile App (Android/iOS)

Digital Kiosk UI

Backend:

Real-time Location Tracking System (e.g., Bluetooth Beacons / Wi-Fi-based)

Station Layout Database

Navigation API

Accessibility Feature Module

Integration Layer for Indian Railways APIs

Cloud Infrastructure:

Server Hosting (e.g., AWS, Azure)

Real-time Database (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB)

(You can include a diagram showing how data flows between app, server, and beacons)

## Use Cases
Passenger finds nearest restroom using mobile app

Visually impaired person receives voice-guided navigation to platform

User at kiosk searches for "Food Court" and gets directions

Station staff updates layout â€” changes reflected instantly in app

App shows platform location and walking time from current location


## Technology Stack
Frontend: Flutter / React Native (for cross-platform mobile app)

Backend: Node.js / Python Flask

Database: Firebase / MongoDB

Mapping: Mapbox / OpenStreetMap with custom 3D mapping

Navigation: Indoor Positioning (Bluetooth beacons or Wi-Fi RTT)

Accessibility: Text-to-speech (TTS), voice recognition (Google Voice API)

Deployment: AWS / Azure

## Dependencies
Real-time location tracking system (BLE/Wi-Fi hardware in stations)

Station layout data from railway authorities

Integration with Indian Railways APIs (PNR, Train Schedule, etc.)

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs

Stable internet access in stations
